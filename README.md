# Recursion to calculate Factorial 
Using the concept of recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. The goal of this program is to further understand how recursion works.

In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science
